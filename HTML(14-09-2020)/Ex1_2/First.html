    <p>
      A basic page needs only a bare minimum of programming. Graphics are an
      important part of Web pages but so too are words. I look upon the Web as a
      medium for ideas and the use of new technologies, but not the other way
      around. A Web page tells a great story with great graphical and analytical
      presentation.

    <p>
      Using the "View" option look at the source code for this document. The
      background color and the text declared in the body refer to a coding
      system that combines a system of numbers and letters to create thousands
      of possible color choices. The body color indicates white and the text as
      being black. I could have just written in "white" and "black" instead of
      these codes.

    <p>Here is an example of a horizontal rule:</p>
    <hr />
    <p>To begin, we can change the</p>
    <h2>header size</h2>
    and <font color="blue">color</font>
    <font color="#ff0000">of</font>
    <font color="#008080">letters</font> seen on the screen. The
    <font size="+2">font size</font>can be changed as well, and actually gives
    more choices.
    <p>
      We can also change the appearance of words on the screen. This shows some
      differing word types in a blocked quote.

    <blockquote>
      <font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sansserif">
        Now is the <em>time </em>for all good <strong>people</strong> to
        <b>come </b>to the <i>aid</i> of their country.
      </font>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"
        >That was also an example of a nested command.
      </font>
